## I am Anthony Huck, a beginner mobile app developer

I am a senior at the Ohio State University and have enrolled in the digital flagship: Swift Coding and App Development Certificate. I am currently working through the first of four courses and have learned a great deal about swift and the app development process. I had no knowledge of swift or iOS development prior to this class, however, I plan to grow and further the skills I have now as well as continue to learn along the way. I look forward to working on more projects as well as discovering more about swift and xCode.
